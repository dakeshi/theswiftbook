The Swift Book
==============

Learn Apple's Swift easily and share your knowledge by contributing fixes and
additions back to The Swift Book.

The Goal
--------

To create an open-source book about Swift! I hope that by making an open-source
book together, we can create a book that covers a much broader domain than that
which Apple publishes for Swift. And besides, it will, without a doubt, be a fun
project to be a part of.
