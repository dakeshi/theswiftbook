The Swift Book
==============

Learn Apple's Swift easily and share your knowledge by contributing fixes and additions back to The Swift Book.

Goal & Vision
-------------

To create an open-source book, about Swift!

Swift is an ever-changing language and to be able to stay on top of these changes, we need a new way of writing content. I don't think any one author can keep a whole book always up to date with new Swift content, so why not leverage the power of GitHub?

GitHub already gives us many of the tools that we need:

-   Ability to write rich text, in Markdown
-   The ability for readers to raise issues through the built-in issue tracking system
-   Pull requests, allowing contributors provide new/updated content
-   Releases, which will allow us to release official updates of this book, every now and then
-   The distributed nature of Git, allowing contributors to write/update content, wherever they are, whenever they want!
