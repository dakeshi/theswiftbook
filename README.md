## Goal & Vision
To create an open-source book, about Swift!

Swift is an ever changing language and to be able to stay on top of these changes, we need a new way of writing content. *One* author cannot keep a whole book always up to date with new Swift content, so why not leverage the power of GitHub and write it together?

GitHub already gives us many of the tools that we need:

-   Ability to write rich text, in Markdown
-   The ability for readers to raise issues through the built-in issue tracking system
-   Pull requests, allowing contributors provide new/updated content
-   Releases, which will allow us to release official updates of this book, every now and then
-   The distributed nature of Git, that allows contributors to write and update content, wherever they are and whenever they wish

## Writing New Content, Fixing Issues
This book is entirely made out of Markdown files (MD) and PNG images for figures. There are code snippets as well which will be inside the text itself.
