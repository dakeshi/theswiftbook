#The Swift Book

Welcome to The Swift Book: The first open-source Swift book, viewed and editable by everyone!

## Who is this book for?
This book is for those who want to learn how to write programs in Apple's programming language; Swift!

The goal of this book is to write the most up to date content for Swift, with peer-reviewed content and examples to ensure accuracy. You need a certain level of understanding of how a computer works, such as:

* How different parts of a computer work together.
* What computer-memory is and how it works.
* What the names of different parts of your computer are, such as the "monitor"!

We will be referring to terms such as RAM, or memory. Should a term be vague, we will provide a definition of it. We will provide a link where you can read more about that term if the definition is not provided in the book itself.
