# The Basics of Swift

Swift is a language that borrows some of its features from other languages such as [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), hence it is very minimalistic in its way of dealing with some basic language constructs, such as functions.

At the heart of the language are [functions](functions.md), [properties](properties.md), [structures](structures.md) and [classes](classes.md), all of which contribute to the majority of what you see as built-in types and functionality.

[Structures](structures.md) allow you to create thread safe objects that are by design immutable. [Classes](classes.md) on the other hand are reference types and can be mutated without warning. Extra work is required to make a class thread-safe.

[Enumerations](enumerations.md) allow you to create a list of similar items, such as apples, oranegs, all of which are fruits (the enumeration). Each case in the enumeration represents an item in the list.

You need to learn about basic [data types](data_types.md) as well, such as [`String`](string.md) and [`Int`](integer.md). Once you learn about data types, you can put them to use by specifying [constants](constants.md) or [variables](variables.md) that take advantage of those data types. Alternatively, you can pass values, known as [arguments](function_arguments.md), of specific data types to [functions](functions.md) as well.
