# Function Return Type

TODO: explain that functions can optionally have return types and even say that the return type can be explicitly or implicitly set to `Void`. give examples of returning basic data types such as Int and String

## Returning Tuples

TODO: link the reader first to tuples.md and then tell her how a function can return a tuple. give as many examples as possible

## Returning Functions

TODO: talk about how a function can return another function and where this can be useful. this will also need a lot of examples and perhaps it's best to link the reader to functional_programming.md for more information about functional programming
