# Structure Initializers

TODO: tell the reader how a structure also like classes needs to have initializers but how we get a free initializer from the compiler by default

## [Free Initializer](#free-initializer)

TODO: give examples of how a structure gets by default a free initializer from the compiler

## [Custom Initializers](#custom-initializers)

TODO: give examples of when a structure might need a custom initializer and explain the initialization hierarchy

## [Default Arguments](#default-arguments)

TODO: write about initializers that have default argument values and how they can be skipped when calling the initializer. tell the reader why we have this possibility and why it might be useful sometimes

## [Optional Initializers](#optional-initializers)

TODO: talk about `init?` and why it is useful. give examples
