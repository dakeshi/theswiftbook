# Data Types

Whenever a value is defined in Swift, either implicitly or explicitly, it gets a type, known as a data type.

A few main data types that you can use in Swift are:

| Data Type | What does it represent? |
| -- | -- |
| [`Int`](integer.md) | An integer, that can be either signed or unsigned, meaning that it can either be positive or negative. |
| [`String`](string.md) | Text, such as *"Hello, World"* |
| [`Double`](double.md) | A value with fraction, such as *1.22* or *123.98* |

In this section of The Swift Book you will learn about soem of the most important and built-in data types that are used in almost every Swift project that you might be able to get your hands on.
