# Data Types

Whenever a value is defined in Swift, either implicitly or explicitly, it gets a type, known as a data type.

A few main data types that you can use in Swift are:

| Data Type | What does it represent? |
| -- | -- |
| [`Int`](integer.md) | An integer, that can be either signed or unsigned, meaning that it can either be positive or negative. |
| 0:3 | 1:3 |
| 0:4 | 1:4 |
