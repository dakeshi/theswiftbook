# Constants

A constant is a storage place for *a value*, with a name and a type which can be implicitly or explicitly specified.

A constant's value cannot be changed after it has been created and named.

## Syntax

The `let` statement allows you to create a constant. What follows after `let` is the name of the constant that has to follow the CamelCase naming convention.
