# Collections

TODO: explain why we need collections and what type of collections are available (SequenceType, Dictionary, Array, etc). It would be nice then to link the user to corresponding sections where we write about each type

## [SequenceType](#sequencetype)

TODO: explain what SequenceType is and tell the reader why types such as Array and Dictionary come from this protocol

## [CollectionType](#collectiontype)

TODO: explain what CollectionType is and that it comes from SequenceType and why Dictionary and Array conform to it

## [Array](#array)

TODO: give a very general description of arrays and then link the user to the chapters/array.md file

## [Dictionary](#dictionary)

TODO: give a very general description of dictionaries and then link the user to the chapters/dictionary.md file
