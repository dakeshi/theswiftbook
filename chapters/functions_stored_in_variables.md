# Storing Functions in Variables

TODO: talk about how a function can be stored in variables or constants and why you would want to do that. Talk about the existence of `typealias` here but don't explain `typealias` since it is explained in functions_defined_as_types.md

## [Calling Functions in Variables](#calling functions-in-variables)

TODO: now that the function is stored inside a variable or a constant, how can we call it? give examples of this

## [Optionally Stored Functions](#optionally-stored-functions)
