# Arrays

Arrays are an ordered, random-access collection of values of the same type. Because elements of an array are stored with an order, you can enumerate its value in sequence. Also, you can get a specific value using an index. An array can hold the same value more than once. Because of the nature of how arrays work, you can easily implement some data collection, such as [the world records holders in swimming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_records_in_swimming). If a variable is declared with an array type, it will be mutable. It means that you can change its value with the new ones, remove its element, or add the new value in the array. An array provides default implementations for many common operations, such as count, filter, map, zip and reduce.
