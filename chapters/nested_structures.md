# Nested Structures

TODO: write about how sometimes it is needed to embed one struct inside another, an example would be the String structure that has many other structures inside itself. Tell the user that they can even instantiate embedded structures

## [Syntax](#syntax)

TODO: give the reader a few examples of nested structures. it's probably best **not** to bring in any examples directly from Apple's Swift header file since they might change in the future and might not match up with the latest versions of Swift
