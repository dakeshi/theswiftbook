# The Swift Book Images Folder

The purpose of this folder is to store all images that are used within the book.


## Image Format

Ensure that all images in this folder are [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics). It's best that we stick to PNG since it is the default file format, when taking screenshots in OS X. It can be changed to JPEG but the quality and image size balance makes it the perfect candidate for use in The Swift Book.


## Where should I store images?

Store all your images in this folder, as a flat structure.


## How should I name the images?

Follow these rules:

* 1. Use underscores instead of spaces.
* Do **not** prefix your images with any chapter name.
* If you take a screenshot and want to draw a shape on it, do the followings:
  * Store the original image with no drawings on it first in this folder (e.g. *xcode_create_new_project.png*).
  * Duplicate the original image and append **\_annotated** to the end of the file name (e.g. *xcode_create_new_project_annotated.png*). This way, should we wish to change the annotation, we still have the original image can don't have to take another screenshot.
* Use lowercase *.png* file extension instead of *.PNG*
